hdns
====

Hacker's DNS server - a pure Perl DNS server - a simple, tiny one

Written in pure Perl - only suppoerts A type requests and is capable of 
simple regexp-based filtering. Mostly a codebase to grow from.

To implement just run the main.pl script and point your dns settings to the 
host where hdns is running.
